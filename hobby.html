        Reading is one of my favourite things to do during my free time. I’m especially drawn to mystery, horror, and action stories because I love the suspense and thrill they bring. Lately, I’ve been enjoying English novels, particularly those written by Hafsah Hamid. Her writing feels so beautiful yet gut-wrenching, making every story emotionally intense and hard to put down. I’ve also tried reading romance novels, but honestly, they’re just not really my cup of tea.

        When it comes to movies, I enjoy the same genres—mystery, action, and horror—but comedy movies are my ultimate comfort watch. Whenever I feel stressed, I usually turn to funny films to lift my mood. White Chicks is one of my all-time favourites because it never fails to make me laugh. I also have a soft spot for late 1990s and 2000s movies, with Legally Blonde being one of my top picks.

        Aside from movies, I love watching sitcoms and crime series in my free time. Shows like Friends, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, and Criminal Minds are always on my watchlist. My favourite characters are Jake Peralta for his humour, Joey Tribbiani for his iconic personality, and Spencer Reid for his intelligence. These shows are not only entertaining but also feel comforting, which is why I keep coming back to them.
