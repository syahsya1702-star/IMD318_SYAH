            <p>My dad, Mohd Fuzi bin Sarriffulddin, was born on 10 April 1975 in Kuala Krai, Kelantan. He’s the quiet type who doesn’t talk much about himself, but his actions say everything. He loves watching movies, especially action films, and he’s someone who’s very hardworking, responsible, and quite stern—but in a caring way. Even though he’s not very talkative, he’s friendly and always there when needed. My mom, Ramlah binti Che Husain, was born on 15 September 1976 in Machang, Kelantan. She’s a gentle and soft-hearted person who cries easily and spreads kindness wherever she goes. She enjoys gardening and loves online shopping, especially when it comes to buying flowers. She has many friends, rarely gets angry, and is always fun to be around. Despite her gentle nature, she’s also a hardworking woman who fills our home with warmth and happiness.</p>

As for me, Nur Aisyah Atasya, I am the third sibling, born on 17 February 2005. I’m a quiet and stern person who doesn’t talk much and inherited most of my father’s characteristics. I enjoy spending time with books and movies and prefer calm, peaceful moments. My youngest sister, Nur Aisyah Khadija, is truly the sunshine of our family. She is funny, gentle, and very easygoing, always bringing laughter wherever she goes. She loves baking, trying new things, going out, online shopping, and dressing up. She is currently furthering her studies at UiTM Segamat, Johor, in English for Professional Communication, and despite her cheerful personality, she studies hard and stays focused on her goals.</p></th>
